# Goal-Tracking-Phone-App

Using Xamarin.Forms framework, a neat personal project that I made to set goals for myself!

I wanted to learn how to use Microsoft's frameworks to create a mobile application to better organize my life.
I expect this app to go be published on the iOS app store and google playstore during 2023 Summer.

## How to run this app on your local machine with Visual Studio 2022
  Have *Mobile development with .NET workload installed*
  
  Create new project using template: Mobile App (Xamarin.Forms)
  
  Fork Goal-Tracking-Phone-App into repository
